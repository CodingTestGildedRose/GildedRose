Use the URL below to authenticate and display current inventory ( in a real web application password and username should be using POST but just wanted to keep it simple).

http://localhost:8080/Authenticate?username=JohnDoe&password=password1

To buy an item:
http://localhost:8080/Buy?name=shoes

The app is storing data in memory instead of database and initializing the list of users(usernames/password) and items on run time.
